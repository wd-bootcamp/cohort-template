## Slack

Slack is our daily written communication tool. It can be accessed via app or web, with the app preferred. We are not alone on the server; there are other courses from Cologne, Munich, and Hamburg, as well as many alumni. Each course has its own private channel.

- **Profile: Profile** pictures make it more personal :-)
- **Absence:** Communicate via Slack, if possible, discuss with coaches early if planned.

## A Small Rule:

Always respond to messages in the thread to ensure only interested parties are notified and messages stay organized.

## Zoom

Our digital classroom is on Zoom.

- Use Reactions for non-verbal responses, such as agreeing, voting, asking for a break, "Please slow down," etc.
- For exercises, there are breakout rooms, and everyone is randomly distributed.

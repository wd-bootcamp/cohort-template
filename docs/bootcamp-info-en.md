## Slack

Slack is our primary written communication tool. It can be accessed via app or web, with the app being preferred. We share the server with other courses from Cologne, Munich, and Hamburg, as well as many alumni. Each course has its own private channel.

- **Profile:** Adding profile pictures makes it more personal. :-)
- **Absence:** Communicate absences via Slack. If planned, discuss them with the coaches early.

## A Small Rule:

Always respond to messages in the thread to ensure only interested parties are notified and messages stay organized.

## Zoom

Our digital classroom is on [Zoom](https://learn.neuefische.de).

- Use **Reactions** for non-verbal responses, such as agreeing, voting, asking for a break, "Please slow down," etc.
- For exercises, breakout rooms are used, and everyone is randomly distributed.

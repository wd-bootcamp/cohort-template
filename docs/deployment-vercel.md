   - From the dropdown, select your personal user account.
   - Find your GitHub repository and click **"Import"**.
3. **Configure Project Settings**
   - For most projects Vercel preconfigures your project correctly.
   - If you are using API Keys or other information stored in a `.env` file, add the information in the section **"Environment Variables"**.
4. **Deploy Your Project**
   - Click **"Deploy"** to start the deployment process.
   - Vercel will clone your repository, install dependencies, build the project, and deploy it automatically.
5. **View Your Deployment**
   - After deployment is complete, youâ€™ll get a URL to visit your live website.
   - Vercel also provides automatic updates: every time you push changes to GitHub, your site will redeploy.
   - When you create a pull request on Github, Vercel will automatcally create a **preview deployment** for that feature branch and post a link in the respective PR.

That's it! You've successfully deployed your project to Vercel. ðŸŽ‰

# Web-Challenges Workflow

Please follow this workflow when working on challenges. It helps you practicing the git branches commands every day. Practice makes perfect!

1. In the `web-challenges` repository, make sure you are on the `main` branch.
2. Create a folder with the name of the session. For example, `css-basic`.
3. Navigate to the folder created in step 2, e.g., `css-basics`.
4. Once you are inside the folder, download **all** the challenges.
5. Navigate back to the main folder of the repository, `web-challenges`.
6. Add the files and create a commit:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add a comment"
   ```

7. Push to the `main` branch:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

8. Decide on which challenge you want to work.
9. Create a **new** branch dedicated to that challenge **only**.
10. Focus solely on that challenge. While working, remember to make multiple `commits`.
11. Upon finishing the work on that challenge, create a pull request (PR) on the GitHub page.
12. Post the url to your PR in the session solution thread on slack.

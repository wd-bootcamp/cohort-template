# ABC of the Spiced Bootcamps

To ensure all participants can be successful, we need mutual respect and a reliable schedule. To keep everyone on the same page, we have compiled important information about the course schedule and basic participation rules. Please read carefully, ask us if something is unclear, and then get excited for great weeks ahead!

## Attendance (Internal)

Classes (remote and/or in-person) take place from Monday to Friday between 8:30 AM and 7:30 PM (exact times are discussed individually within the course, and attendance is mandatory during this period, including via Google Meet). Group work and tasks may need to be completed in the evenings or on weekends, but this should be discussed with your instructors. Remember, this is your time and your unique opportunity to gain as much knowledge as possible.

## Absence (External)

If you cannot attend the course due to illness or important appointments, you must notify your instructor via Discord before 8:30 AM on the respective day. Otherwise, the course day will be considered "unexcused absence." A certificate for each absence (medical certificate, certificate of job interviews, etc.) must be submitted via the [Absence Report](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdbfuVumSlLVCbouHPnSVCLoHeRqdk1ckuNJARv1ck8Zwp5-A/viewform?usp=send_form). Absences of more than three consecutive days must be discussed separately. If you miss more than three days, achieving the course goal may already be at risk - a certificate may no longer be issued. Always contact your instructors immediately, and we will try to find a solution together. A refund of the participation fee for failure to achieve the course goal for reasons not attributable to us is not possible. Participation in meetings with your instructors or the Career Service is also mandatory. Additionally, all participants are required to be on time for each class and event. Delays can only be tolerated if an important personal reason exists and the delay is announced in advance.

## Absence (Internal)

Is the course overwhelming? Are the topics too easy for you? Can't concentrate during class? Please contact your instructors immediately or directly reach out to the Student Service Team. We are happy to help wherever we can!

## Remote Courses

Our courses are conducted partially in remote mode. Course participants are encouraged to turn on their cameras during active discussions, presentations, or other course-related activities. This rule is intended to promote active participation without unnecessarily infringing on participants' privacy. Exceptions to this rule can only be made if a corresponding medical certificate, an important personal reason communicated in advance, or a similar certificate is provided.

## Feedback Culture

We always strive to improve and design your course optimally! For open and professional interaction, we regularly collect anonymous feedback from you. Please participate and also provide timely and constructive feedback independently. You can and should address wishes, questions, and suggestions at any time to your Student Service support and your instructors.

## Friendliness and Communication

Friendliness, mutual respect, and adherence to applicable law are the top directives for interaction in the course. We do not tolerate eye-rolling, refusals, physical or psychological violence, verbal outbursts, racism, extremism, xenophobia, homophobia, sexism, ableism, and bullying. Respectful and constructive communication is essential for a successful course. Deliberate disruptions or provocations impair the learning success of other participants and will not be tolerated. Please also be friendly and approachable to your instructors, just as they are open and friendly to you. Please address any issues immediately and personally so that we can respond and continually improve.

## Recordings by Participants

Class sessions, whether in-person or remote, may not be recorded without the consent of the instructors and all other involved persons. This applies regardless of the technology used and includes both audio and video recordings of any kind. Participants are informed that unauthorized recordings can also have civil, data protection, and criminal consequences. Unauthorized recordings entitle us to terminate the contractual relationship with the respective participants without notice and to exclude the participant from the course.

## Recordings by Spiced

In some courses, we record video and audio of instructors and participants during our live sessions. This allows you to watch the sessions later, practice with them, or view them if you missed a session due to illness. Employees who use these recordings to prepare and improve the courses also have access to the recordings. We use protected areas of common providers (e.g., YouTube private, Google Meet, Discord, or Google Drive) for the recordings. Importantly, whether or not recording takes place is decided by the instructors.

## Creation of Content with AI

We expect our participants to independently create code and other content unless explicitly stated otherwise. AI-generated code may be used if it meets curriculum standards and participants can explain it in detail. In individual cases, approval from instructors may be obtained. We encourage participants to integrate future technologies into their workflow. However, insufficient explanations or passing off AI-generated code as independently created, especially in the final project, may lead to course failure.

## Course Content and Feedback by AI

We occasionally use AI tools to produce or customize course content. In some course formats, we use AI-supported automation to provide participants with faster and more individualized feedback on their code or other content. We are transparent about our use of modern tools and are happy to answer questions about where AI is used.

## Deadlines and Appointments

We need data and information about you and your capstone project for your certificate. Please submit this data on time (you will receive information from the instructors and the Student Service Team). If your data is submitted late, we cannot guarantee a complete certificate.

## Helpfulness

Directive: Everyone helps as best they can, ideally the person next to them! Mutual support is a fundamental pillar of our understanding of teamwork. You learn a lot yourself when you help others and also benefit greatly from their help. Did you find a great tutorial? Do you have a mnemonic for a complex problem? Does someone need a code review? This is your chance!

## Help, Content-wise

If you need help or have difficulty understanding something, contact your instructors and your team first. Independent research may also help.

## Help, Organizational

Do you need a course certificate or want to submit a certificate yourself? Do you want to talk to someone? Contact your Student Service support (preferably via Discord or via [Student Support Desk](https://noteforms.com/forms/student-support-qaq62n)).

## Participation

Our community and our courses rely on everyone contributing within their means. Without motivation, a successful course is challenging. See more â†’ Independence

## Independence

Spiced expects a high level of self-responsibility, independence, and teamwork from all participants. This includes:

- Asking questions
- Helping team members
- Independent research on topics
- Keeping minutes independently
- Reviewing other participants' code
- Meeting deadlines and appointments
- Addressing problems promptly
- Independent review of the content is mandatory!

## Discord (Rules)

Discord is the most important communication tool at Spiced. Familiarize yourself with it with the help of your coaches. You will find all relevant information there and be informed of any news. Please enter your full name and upload a meaningful profile picture before the first course day. Please note that general data protection rules also apply to Discord; do not post private conversations from closed channels in public areas. Whenever possible, feel free to contact the coaches in the channel or via DM. Participants may only create their own channels after consultation. Please remain friendly and helpful. Discord is primarily intended for course communication. Debates, forums, and discussions on topics outside the course should be conducted through other communication channels to ensure the successful completion of the bootcamp for everyone.

**In the event of particularly serious or repeated significant violations of these course rules, Spiced reserves the right to exclude participants from the course. As far as it is reasonable for us and the other course participants, we will issue a warning before an exclusion.**
